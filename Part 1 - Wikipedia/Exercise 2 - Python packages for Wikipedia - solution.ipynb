      "Cologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the river Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The Napoleonic code remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] and then the [[Rhine Province]].\n",

      "The permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.\n",

Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages.

This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].\n",

      "Located in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] area, Cologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany. It has a [[Temperateness|temperate]]–[[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen: ''Cfb'']]) with cool winters and warm summers. It is also one of the cloudiest cities in Germany, with just 1,567.5 hours of sun a year. Its average annual temperature is {{convert|10.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}: {{convert|15.4|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|6.1|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. In January, the mean temperature is {{convert|3.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the mean temperature in July is {{convert|19.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The record high temperature of {{convert|40.3|°C|0|abbr=on}} happened on 25 July 2019 during the [[July 2019 European heat wave]] in which Cologne saw three consecutive days over {{convert|38.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Especially the inner urban neighbourhoods experience a greater number of hot days, as well as significantly higher temperatures during nighttime compared to the surrounding area (including the airport, where temperatures are classified).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dwd.de/DE/klimaumwelt/klimaforschung/klimawirk/stadtpl/stadtklimaprojekte/projekt_koeln/start_klima_koeln21.html|title=Wetter und Klima - Deutscher Wetterdienst - Stadtklima Köln - Klimawandelgerechte Metropole Köln - Strategie zur Anpassung an den Klimawandel (KÖLN_21)|website=www.dwd.de|access-date=20 January 2021|archive-date=4 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210604131150/https://www.dwd.de/DE/klimaumwelt/klimaforschung/klimawirk/stadtpl/stadtklimaprojekte/projekt_koeln/start_klima_koeln21.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Still temperatures can vary noticeably over the course of a month with warmer and colder weather.

The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstraße (\"Federal Road\") B 55a'', which begins at the ''Zoobrücke'' (\"Zoo Bridge\") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals.
