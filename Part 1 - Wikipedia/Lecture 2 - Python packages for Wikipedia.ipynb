      "Mannheim has a population of about 315,000 and is the 2nd largest city in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. Mannheim became a major city in the early 19th century due to its industrialization. Its location of [[Rhine]] and [[Neckar]] rivers made Mannheim an attractive place for industrialization. Mannheim was heavily destroyed after WWII but became a major industrial city a few years later. In the 1950s the population in Mannheim grew rapidly due to the heavy industrialization where many motor, electronic and power plant companies came to Mannheim and other surrounding cities like [[Ludwigshafen]] and [[Heidelberg]]. The population of Mannheim started to decline in the 1980s but it started to grow in the 2010s due to its university where many students came to this city and made Mannheim one of the most popular university cities in Germany.\n",

      "The city centre uses an addressing system that is unique within Germany. Rather than street names and numbers, each block is given a code and a number is given to each building: C3, 17 is block C3, building 17. The practice dates back centuries and is a result of the original use of the city centre as a fort, with the fort's internal system being adopted when it became public streets. The streets themselves are unnamed. The codes are laid out in a simple progressive pattern: C3 is between C2 and C4 in one direction and B3 and D3 in the other. However, those unused to the system will often become lost. A street named Breite Straße goes through the middle of the blocks from south to north, with blocks A-K on the west side of the street and L-U on the east, with each row going 1 to at most 7 based on distance from this road. House numbers begin on the south corner nearest Breite Straße and go counterclockwise for A-K and clockwise for L-U.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twomonkeystravelgroup.com/7-awesome-things-mannheim-germany/|title=Mannheim, Germany – 7 Awesome Things To Do|website=twomonkeystravelgroup.com|date=14 November 2015}}</ref>\n",
      "\n",
      "That causes major issues with most mapping software, as the databases that they use are based on the standard street-number system, and so the software cannot accommodate a completely different system for a small area. A variety of fixes have been tried, none with a high level of success. In particular, the systems have issues because an address on a block can be on any of up to four roads and so attempts to fix the issue by giving the roads false names within the database have often failed to give accurate addressing, but such can still be seen on some platforms like [[Google Maps]]. Finding an address in the area thus generally requires resorting to asking directions or using one of the many posted public maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSG-zxGRkJw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/DSG-zxGRkJw| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|title=The European City Centre With No Street Names|last=Tom Scott|date=19 February 2018|via=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n",

      "Mannheim (; Palatine German:  or ), officially the University City of Mannheim (), is the second-largest city in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, after the state capital of Stuttgart, and Germany's 21st-largest city, with a 2021 population of 311,831 inhabitants. The city is the cultural and economic centre of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, Germany's seventh-largest metropolitan region with nearly 2.4 million inhabitants and over 900,000 employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mannheim is located at the confluence of the Rhine and the Neckar in the Kurpfalz (Electoral Palatinate) region of northwestern Baden-Württemberg. The city lies in the Upper Rhine Plain, Germany's warmest region. Together with Hamburg, Mannheim is the only German city bordering two other federal states. It forms a continuous conurbation of around 480,000 inhabitants with Ludwigshafen am Rhein in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate, on the other side of the Rhine. Some northern suburbs of Mannheim belong to Hesse. Upstream along the Neckar lies Heidelberg, the fifth-largest city of Baden-Württemberg and the third-largest of the Rhine-Neckar Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mannheim is unusual among German cities in that its city centre streets and avenues are laid out in a grid pattern, leading to the city's nickname Quadratestadt (Square City). Within a ring of avenues surrounding the city centre, there are squares, numbered from A1 to U6, instead of street names. At the southern base of that system is Mannheim Palace, one of the largest palace complexes in the world, and the second-largest in Baroque style after Versailles. It was the former home of the Prince-elector of the Electoral Palatinate, and now houses the University of Mannheim, which repeatedly receives top marks in business administration and is sometimes known as the \"Harvard of Germany\". The Mannheim May Market is the largest regional consumer exhibition of Germany. The civic symbol of Mannheim is the Romanesque Mannheim Water Tower, completed in 1886 and rising to  above the highest point of the art nouveau area Friedrichsplatz. Mannheim is well-known for its inventions, including the automobile, the bicycle, and the tractor, which is why the city is often called the \"city of inventions\". The city is the starting and finishing point of the Bertha Benz Memorial Route, which follows the tracks of the first long-distance automobile trip in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Großstadt (major city with more than 100,000 inhabitants) since 1896, Mannheim is now an important industrial and commercial city, a university town, and a major transportation hub between Frankfurt and Stuttgart, including an ICE interchange (the Mannheim Hauptbahnhof), Germany's second-largest marshalling yard (the Mannheim Rangierbahnhof), and Germany's largest inland port (the Mannheim Harbour). The city is home to many factories, offices and headquarters of several major corporations such as Roche, ABB, IBM, Siemens, Unilever and more. Mannheim's SAP Arena is home to German ice hockey record champions Adler Mannheim as well as the popular handball team Rhein-Neckar Löwen. Since 2014, Mannheim has been a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and holds the title of \"UNESCO City of Music\". In 2020, Mannheim was classified as a global city with 'Sufficiency' status by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC). Mannheim is a smart city; the city's electrical grid is installed with a power-line communication network. The city's tourism slogan is \"Leben im Quadrat\" (\"Life in the Square\").\n"
